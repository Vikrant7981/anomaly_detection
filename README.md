Here we have tried to implement the research paper "VELC: A New Variational AutoEncoder Based
Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection"

Paper link :- https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01702

# Data
The code uses NASA bearing data set for training and test. The bearing data has been uploaded to the folder named "dataset" here itself in the repository.

Dataset link :- https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/

## Code uses the rest of the folders to save model and the Images.
