Here we have tried to implement the research paper "VELC: A New Variational AutoEncoder Based
Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection"

Paper link :- https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01702

Main Model file that is to be run is velc_model.py

# Data
The code uses NASA bearing data set for training and test. The bearing data has been uploaded to the folder named "dataset" here itself in the repository.

Dataset link :- https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/

We have done some pre-processing and the final output "Bearing_dataset.csv" datatset file that is used by model is present in "dataset" folder.
Code that is used in pre-processing is also available in "pre_processing.py".

To Show some insights about the raw data, we have generated some graphs, code of which is available at "data_insights.py".

## Code uses the rest of the folders to save model and the Images.
